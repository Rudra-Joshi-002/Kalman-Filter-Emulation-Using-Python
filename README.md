# Kalman Filter from The Ground Up — Python Implementations

This repository contains clean, well-documented Python implementations of Kalman Filter examples as described in the book:

**📘 "Kalman Filter from The Ground Up" by Alex Becker**

---

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build a **chapter-wise collection** of Kalman filter examples.
- Implement each filter using **Python**, adhering to a consistent and beginner-friendly coding style.
- Recreate **plots and outputs** shown in the book using simulated and measured data.
- Provide **in-line comments, structured logic**, and clear variable naming to help students and engineers learn the concepts intuitively.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder in this repo corresponds to a chapter from the book. Inside each folder:

- Python scripts are named according to the example or topic (e.g., `Ex-1.py`, `Ex-2.py`).
- Scripts include:
  - A detailed explanation block (commented section) at the top.
  - Clear **prediction and update equations** written in readable format.
  - Proper **plots** for true, measured, predicted, and estimated values.
  - A consistent printing format for tracking filter performance.
